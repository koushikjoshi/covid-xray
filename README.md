# COVID DETECTION USING X-RAY IMAGES
## Description:
Moderate to highly symptomatic cases of COVID-19 have reported lung damage, which can be detected using AI techniques like Deep Learning.
This model can detect COVID from x-ray images with 97% accuracy.

## The Model:
The deep learning model is trained using an ensemble of a generic-structure Convolutional Neural Network architecture and ImageNet transfer learning, which is partly the reason behind the high accuracy of this model.

## The necessary files:
final_model.model - the directory containing the trained model.

covid_detector.ipynb - the Python notebook file containing the code used to build and train the model.

## Demo: The working of the model:
